            Our entire life when we shop, we are limited by choices that are
            there in a store. We are often on the side where we buy our
            favourite coloured shoes made by someone else but what if we
            designed it? What if we could involve in the making of a shoe we
            want to buy? This little thought sprouted to become what we are
            today, KICKSUP! ;)

          <h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
          <p className="py-1">
            Understanding the trends in the industry and what the users think
            when they buy were our top priorities before we moved further in the
            building. After weeks of fruitful research, we stepped into the
            user's shoes and look at what we plan to do. It's a great joy for
            the users if they are involved in the making. We're heading into an
            era of technology and people prefer online shopping to shopping in
            an outlet.

            Every milestone begins with a single step and before KICKSUP
            sprouted, the team manufactured in small scale with two users a
            month. This experience was crucial to our brand as this is our first
            practical experience. Interacting with the users was the best thing
            ever. The positive reviews and support from people motivated us to
            push our limits further.
